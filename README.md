# The Arcane Scholar's Legacy
**Videogame: single-player, text-based idle game with significant strategic depth.**
Players inherit a forgotten arcane sanctum and must uncover lost knowledge, manage mystical resources, conduct risky experiments, and strategically expand their influence in a world veiled in magical secrets. The core appeal lies in the addictive idle progression loop combined with meaningful strategic choices in faction alignment (Light vs. Darkness), research paths (Arcane vs. Alchemy), resource management, and sanctum development, all presented through evocative text, built using standard web technologies. The game emphasizes a deep narrative and a balanced progression system that avoids pay-to-win mechanics.
